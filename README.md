# Python Lab 1

## Introduction
This project is part of the Python course at Fanshawe College. The goal is to solve three programming tasks: identifying palindromes in nested lists, performing element-by-element matrix multiplication, and producing a single scalar number by multiplying elements of a list.

## Requirements
- Python 3.12

## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Python_Lab1
   ```

## Usage
Run the script to execute the three requirements.

```bash
python lab1.py
```

## Functions

### `IsPalindrome(a)`
Checks if a given list is a palindrome.
- **Parameters:**
  - `a` (list): A list to be checked for palindrome properties.
- **Returns:**
  - `bool`: `True` if the list is a palindrome, `False` otherwise.

### `mul(mat_1, mat_2)`
Multiplies two matrices element by element.
- **Parameters:**
  - `mat_1` (list of lists): The first matrix.
  - `mat_2` (list of lists): The second matrix.
- **Returns:**
  - `list of lists`: A matrix containing the result of element-by-element multiplication.

### `ToMultiply(list1)`
Multiplies all elements of a list to produce a single scalar number.
- **Parameters:**
  - `list1` (list): A list of numbers to be multiplied.
- **Returns:**
  - `int/float`: The resulting product of all elements in the list.
